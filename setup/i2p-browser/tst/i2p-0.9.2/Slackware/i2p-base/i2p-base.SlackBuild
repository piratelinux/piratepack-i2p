# Heavily based on the Slackware 12.2 SlackBuild
# Slackware build script for I2P
#
# PLEASE READ THIS:
# How to start I2P:
# After installpkg command, doinst.sh will execute a post-installation script
# needed by I2P. After that you have to chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.i2p and start
# I2P service with /etc/rc.d/rc.i2p start.
#
# Now tell your browser to user this proxy: localhost on port 4444 and open
# this page: http://localhost:7657/index.jsp
#
# Here you can configure I2P, watch network status and navigate anonimously.
# It's suggested to subscribe to various dns host, like i2host.i2p
# For any additional information, visit i2host.i2p and forum.i2p
