<h3>2012-09-21: <b>0.9.2 <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/release-0.9.2.html">Released</a></b></h3>

<p>
0.9.2 includes extensive low-level changes to improve the performance and efficiency of the router.
We have updated our UPnP library, to hopefully make UPnP work for more people.
I2PSnark now has DHT support, but it is not yet enabled by default, as we plan to do more
testing during the upcoming 0.9.3 development cycle.
As usual, there's also lots of bug fixes in this release, so updating is recommended.
