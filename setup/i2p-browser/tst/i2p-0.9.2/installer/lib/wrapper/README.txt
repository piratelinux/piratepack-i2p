Wrapper update instructions:

Get the community "delta pack" from http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/download.jsp

Get the source from http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/downloads/

From the delta pack, copy lib/wrapper.jar to all/

From the delta pack, strip the binaries in lib/
(if you have the tools to do so for that architecture) and copy
to xxx/librapper.so, libwrapper.jnilib, or wrapper.dll for the following directories.
Don't forget to disable the execute bit.
	linux (x86-32)
	linux64 (x86-64)
	solaris (sparc-32)
	win32

From the delta pack, strip the binaries in bin/ and copy
to xxx/i2psvc for the same directories as above.
Don't forget to disable the execute bit.

For armv5 and armv7, build from source following the instructions
in linux-armv7/README.txt.
Don't forget to strip the binaries and disable the execute bit.
We use a trimslice for armv7 building.

For freebsd and freebsd64, we don't use the Tanuki binaries
because they are compiled in FBSD v6.  Compile from source in
FreeBSD 7.4 to eliminate the dependency on the compat6x port.
Don't forget to strip the binaries and disable the execute bit.
A walkthrough can be found in freebsd/README.txt.

For linux-ppc, we don't use the Tanuki binaires because they're (mistakenly)
ppc64 compiles (TODO: File bug with Tanuki). Compile the arch-dependent bits
with "ant -Dbits=32 compile-c-unix".

For macosx, combine (if possible) the universal-32 and universal-64 files
from the delta pack (each is a 2-architecture fat file)
into a "quad-fat" binary. Instructions can be found in
macos/README.txt

For win64, build from source following the instructions
in win64/README-x64-win.txt.
Don't forget to strip the binaries and disable the execute bit.
