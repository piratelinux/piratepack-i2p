This is a major rewrite of KBucket, KBucketSet, and KBucketImpl from net.i2p.router.networkdb.kademlia.
The classes are now generic to support SHA1. SHA256, or other key lengths.
The long-term goal is to prove out this new implementation in i2psnark,
then move it to core, then convert the network database to use it.
