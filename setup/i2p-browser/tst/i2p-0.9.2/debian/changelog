i2p (0.8.12-1) stable; urgency=low

  * New upstream I2P release
  * Debconf:
    - add wrapper.java.maxmemory from wrapper.config

      clarified.
    - Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian translation updates
  * Initscript changes/fixes:
    - increase shutdown wait-time in initscript
    - renumber "wrapper.additional" lines (since gaps are allowed with newer
      wrapper versions)
    - move I2PTEMP to /tmp/i2p-daemon
    - move router.ping to /var/run/i2p
    - various other clean-ups
    - explicity redirect errors to stderr
  * maintainer scripts:
    - postinst: rewrite the handling of an existing i2psvc account
    - postrm: remove /etc/default/i2p if the package is purged

i2p (0.8.4-2) stable; urgency=low

  * Stop including /usr/share/i2p/lib/jbigi.jar. 
  * Compile a dynamic jbigi and create a new package, libjbigi-jni. Since I
    can't get jcpuid to compile I take this library from jbigi.jar.
    Unfortunately it was not compiled with -fPIC, causing lintian to complain.
    Additionally it is a 32bit compile, forcing libc-i386 to be installed on 
    amd64 boxes. 
  * Add dependency on libc-i386 because of jcpuid and a build-dep on unzip for
    the same reason.
  * Don't display errors generated from chowning files that don't exist.
  * Bug fix: Somehow I missed packaging the geoip information before. Oops.
  * Bug fix: Add history.txt to /usr/share/i2p. I didn't realize it was shown
    in the console at /help.
  * Since I'm packaging the missing geoip information, I use an updated
    geoiodb from tor (taken from Debian package tor-geoipdb version
    0.2.2.22-alpha-1)
  * Patching countries.txt to add entries that are in Maxmind's database.
  * Now using debconf to ask about running as a daemon.
  * From this point forward, users will be asked to confirm that they want to
    upgrade this package, due to it requiring a router reboot.
  * Updated README.Debian to better explain differences compared with
    upstream.
  * Add history.txt to /usr/share/i2p
