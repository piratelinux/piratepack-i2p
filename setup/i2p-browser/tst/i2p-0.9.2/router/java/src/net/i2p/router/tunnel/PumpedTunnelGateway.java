/**
 * This is used for all gateways with more than zero hops.
 *
 * Serve as the gatekeeper for a tunnel, accepting messages, coallescing and/or
 * fragmenting them before wrapping them up for tunnel delivery. The flow here
 * is: <ol>
 * <li>add an I2NPMessage (and a target tunnel/router, if necessary)</li>
 * <li>that message is queued up into a TunnelGateway.Pending and offered to the
 *     assigned QueuePreprocessor.</li>
 * <li>that QueuePreprocessor may then take off any of the TunnelGateway.Pending
 *     messages or instruct the TunnelGateway to offer it the messages again in
 *     a short while (in an attempt to coallesce them).
 * <li>when the QueueProcessor accepts a TunnelGateway.Pending, it preprocesses
 *     it into fragments, forwarding each preprocessed fragment group through 
 *     the Sender.</li>
 * <li>the Sender then encrypts the preprocessed data and delivers it to the 
 *     Receiver.</li>
 * <li>the Receiver now has the encrypted message and may do with it as it 
 *     pleases (e.g. wrap it as necessary and enqueue it onto the OutNetMessagePool,
 *     or if debugging, verify that it can be decrypted properly)</li>
